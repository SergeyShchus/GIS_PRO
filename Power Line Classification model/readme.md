There are deep learning classification models available at ArcGIS Online, such as the Tree Point Classification model and Power Line Classification model. These models were trained by expert data scientists. If these models are appropriate for your project, you can use them to classify your point clouds. If these models are not suitable for your project, you can train your own models from scratch using your own training data, or use your data to tune the pretrained models.
